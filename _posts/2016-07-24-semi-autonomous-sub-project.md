In college I worked on a semi-autonomous sub for my senior design project. The purpose of the project long term was to create a fully autonomous submarine that could be used by the school as a platform for robotics research. Starting with a broken sub I worked with my team to fix the mechanical issues and get semi-autonomous operation using ROS .

Our team was the third team to join the project. The first team constructed the sub and had a basic remote control function. Another team came along after and after a semester did not leave any significant contributions. We took on the project and fixed issues left over from previous teams and took on the task of improving the software. 

The hardware was upgraded to a Raspberry Pi 2. The semi-autonomous software was written in ROS. If anyone has used ROS they will know the hardest part is getting it installed. This was one of our challenges, once everything was installed the code was relatively simple. I wrote the ROS modules in Python. The full code can be seen here [https://github.com/tylerburnham42/MercerSubProject](https://github.com/tylerburnham42/MercerSubProject).
