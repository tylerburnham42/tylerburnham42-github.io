At Mercer University in 2015, I worked on a semi-autonomous sub for my senior design project. The purpose of the project long term was to create a fully autonomous submarine that could be used by the school as a platform for robotics research.  The project started before us and a base sub was created. It was able to be controlled by an xbox controller. When we started the sub had fallen into a state of disrepair. I worked with my team Andrew Buff (Vision Software) and Jonathan Alfred (Electrical Work/Physical Changes) to fix the semi-autonomous operation using ROS.

The hardware was upgraded to a Raspberry Pi 2. The semi-autonomous software was written in ROS. If anyone has used ROS they will know the hardest part is getting it installed. This was one of our biggest challenges since I was new to ROS at the time. Once everything was installed the code was relatively simple. I wrote some ROS modules in Python to create a command queue and pass those commands with timings to an Arduino controlling the motors.
